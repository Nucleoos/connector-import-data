Abstract Module that give the posibility to store a data and to
create a job to process it. Usefull for importing data using the
connector module.

This module enhance base_import in order to run asynchronously and atomically imports.
It uses connector in order to create an import job by row from a csv file.
This module is working but it's for now a prototype, we may want to add the posibility to support mapping.
